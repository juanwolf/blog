# Introduction to stackstorm

## Introduction

I am sure you've heard about github being able to deploy cool stuff from their chat platform and all this fancy kind of stuff. At my current job, we use stackstorm, a framework for developing remote execution tools easily and "refined".

## Chatops?

The last past years has been a big changes for entreprises, the raise of the devops practices, agility, telework and all this kind of stuff... A new trend at the moment on a devops/sysadmin point of view is using chat bots to deal with infrastructure and remote execution. Yeah you got it right, you'll use your chat platforms to deploy new applications, check the state of your app, or even provision new vms, amazing isn't it? That's what we call "Chatops".

## Why Stackstorm?

Their's tons of bot engine in the world. You might have heard about [hubot](https://github.com/hubot/hubot), the github bot engine written in coffeescript letting you write 'scripts' for custom actions.
