Hi everyone ! Today I'll speak about The Wolf Among Us, a game
available since 2013 (with the last episode available in July 2014)
developed by Telltale Games (The Walking Dead) and distributed by Warner
Bros and Vertigo. This game is a "Point & Click" or a "graphic
adventure" by this kind grandpa Wikipedia.

The Point & Click
-----------------

I'll do a little introduction about this kind of game, not really known
now. This style has been created in 1987 by Ron Gilbert who was working
for Lucasfilm Games (became LucasArts) for the game "Maniac
Mansion" which can be qualified of the first point & click game. So
what it is? You're asking me. Be patient, I'll tell you in few
seconds. So the game is composed with a graphic interface composed by
text icons which give you actions your character can do. You just have
to click on this icon and your character will execute it, easy isn't
it? But before that, video game was quite harder! Before you had to
write the action you wanted to do, and you had to see the world as a
developer which is not easy. For example, you wanted to open a door with
a key, so you'll write "Open door", right? But the game expected
"insert key". Awesome to be blocked just for that isn't it? So it
was a huge progress for the user experience!

The story
---------


GRANDPA, GRANDPA, TELL US A STORY :


> "The Wolf Among Us is an adventure based on the comics "Fables"
> written by Bill Willingham. The Wolf Among Us is set in the year 1986,
> decades before the events of the first issue of Fables. For years, many
> of the magical and mystical lands described in myth, legend, and
> folklore (known colloquially as "the homelands") have been
> occupied by an enigmatic tyrant known only as the Adversary. To escape
> the Adversary's marauding armies and totalitarian regime many creatures
> and characters known as "fables" fled to the mundane
> world  and created an enclave known as Fabletown in colonial America, now located in
> modern-day Manhattan. To mask their presence from the native humans
> (referred to as "mundies") all non-human fables have to purchase
> an enchantment known as a "glamour" which allows them to appear
> human, or be relocated to a rural community known as "The Farm".
> The reformed Big Bad Wolf, Bigby Wolf (voiced by Adam Harrington), is the
> sheriff of Fabletown and is responsible for hiding the community from
> the wider world and enforcing its laws."

As grandpa said, Fables and The Wolf Among Us will relate the
contemporary story of the fables tales we heard when we was kind and
nice. However Manhattan changed them a lot... You'll find a Big Bad
Wolf addicted to the nicotine searching the way of the redemption, a
White Snow near to throw up when she heard something about dwarfs, and I
hide to you the worst part (I will not spoil you all the story, are you
crazy ?). Don't expect to live a fairy tale playing this game. And a
lot of time during this game you'll have this face (mostly at every
episodes end) :

To keep the idea of a comic or a show TV, this game is cut by 5 episodes
which everyone have an intro and a credit end. The Wolf Among Us is a
kind of "Video Game Show" !

The Gameplay
------------

This game is a mix of point & click and quick time events, if you don't
know what's the first one, I'll break your face and the second one is
a basic action during a cinematic from the player (I'll explain better
after).

We can cut the investigation moment with the point & click gameplay and
the action time with the quick time events (QTE).

### Investigation phase

As I said before investigation phases will be played with the point &
click mode. An image is more understandable than few words :

Here you can see you can interact with diferent element in the game as a
phone or the door. You just have to click on it and Bigby will interact
with it. You'll be able to collect some items you'll find during the
game which can change some point during the investigation or be used by
someone.

### Quick Time Events (QTE)

I did a brief introduction about the QTE. Let's see what grandpa
Wikipedia say about it :

> In video games a quick time event (QTE) is a method of gameplay
> initial;"=""} in which the player performs actions on the control
> device shortly after the appearance of an on-screen prompt. It allows
> for limited control of the game character during cut scenes
> sequences in the game. Performing the prompted action improperly or
> not at all results in the character's failure at their task and often
> in an immediate game over
>
> The term "quick time event" is attributed to Yu
> Suzuki, director of the game Shenmue which
> used the QTE feature to a great degree. They allow for the game
> designer to create sequences of actions that cannot be expressed
> through the game's standard control scheme, or to constrain the
> player into taking only one specific action at a critical moment.
> While some uses of QTE have been considered as favorable additions to
> gameplay, the general use of QTE has been panned by journalists and
> players alike, as these events can break the flow of the game and
> force the player to repeat sections until they master the event.

Thanks grandpa, it always sounds better from you. So, you'll have the
pleasure to participate to some Bigby's fights as break the face of the
woodsman :

But even during QTE, every choices you make will change the story as
during dialogues phases.

### Dialogues Phases

Dialogues, the most important part of the game, and I forgot to
introduce it before, I'll never change ! The story is the most
important point in the game, so the dialogues have to be the same !
During your first minutes playing this game you'll see:

I have to admit I loved it ! You'll be the master of this adventure and
your choice will change your game experience. So you'll be able to
choose if Bigby will be the worst guy ever or a Big Bad Wolf in the way
of the redemption. But be careful, silence is a way to respond, so
don't be too low to respond or you'll not be able to it (sometimes the
time allowed to respond is quite small) ! And every response you'll
choose will have an influence on the relationship you'll have with
every character.

Graphics
--------

The graphic universe use the cartoon style we can meet on games as
Borderlands or The Walking Dead. It's not as the comic universe you can
know if you're reading the "Fables" comic but this new style is a
good choice from the Telltale studio because they can play with dark
atmosphere in the story and show some gore moment without hide
something. The cartoon style give a lighter way to this atmosphere quite
hard to live. About the specifications for this game, you'll not need a
gamer PC to have beautiful graphics, mine is 5 years old and it works
perfectly in High. (GPU: Nvidia GT325M if you're interested). So even
if you're young or quite sensible, don't be scared this game is
survivable thanks to this king of graphics !

Yeah, I'll try to not put a screenshot quite gore, I don't want to
spoil you or even make throw up (I'm the nicest guy you ever met, I
know) !  If you didn't have enough, here's the like to my screenshot
gallery of this game (episode 1 et 2):[the galerie](https://plus.google.com/photos/101870222559537773141/albums/6049669051617371633).

Conclusion
----------

The Wolf Among Us is a good adventure/Point&Click game. It's story is
just amazing, I could not stop to play until I finish the story ! I
played the 5 episodes during 8 hours (one day). If you like thrillers,
fables or just video games, this game is for you !!
