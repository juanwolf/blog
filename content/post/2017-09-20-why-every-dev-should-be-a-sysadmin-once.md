# Going to the dark side: Why every dev should cross the line to join the sys admin side at least once in their carreer

## Introduction

It's been a year since I joined the Claranet Technology Group as System Developer (which means literally noob sys admin but he can write some code) and I wanted to give a little feedback of why I think more dev should experemient at least for a week or a year what a traditional sysadmin does.

I'll not sell the company or back stab it, I'lll just give my little impressions how a sysadmin environment can increase and make you a better coder.

## The context

Before the joy of being a nooby sysadmin, I was a peaceful web developer for Airinov dealing with a client faced application developed in Django. A nice project to start my carreer with, gave me some headaches and nightmares but was really good experience. Until I decided to move to the UK. I had the chance to have been contacted by a good recruiting agency (no advertising here) and made me pass some interview including two for Claranet.
