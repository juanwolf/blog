** Introduction
I did not play the switch for quite a while, isn't it? Nintendo: "We gamified the sports industry, come have a look". Alright...
One of the main selling point of the Switch was their amazing controller that could be fitted anywhere. I remember before the Switch got propered released,
people were getting crazy about the accessories that could get released with this new system.
Who could have thought that one of the most selling game would be the new version of the Wii Fit?

** Mechanics
   As you might know already, the Ring Fit Adventure game can't be played without it's accessory the ring.
*** The Ring & co
    The ring is a device where you install your joycon and press it to trigger an action. At first,
you might think that apart from pressing the ring, there's not much to do... However, the Nintendo team succeeded to include more than 40 different exercises
to this device! As well, you need to couple the ring with a strap to your leg to detect running activities or if you're sit down on the floor etc... To be honest,
I was a bit unsure on the recognition of your movement but it works really well! Most of the time I thought the game was not recognizing properly my movements
were because I was doing the exercises wrong.

** Story
   Let's be clear, the story is not main selling point of this game. The story starts with you waking up in strange lands. A ring is weirdly calling for your help.
It apparently got sealed. You decide to break the seal with your massive muscles, when suddenly you realise that Dragaux, a dragon filled with _dark influence_ escaped from it.
The ring starts suddenly talking to you, saying that Dragaux was defeated a long time ago by the Ring itself but to seal Dragaux it gave all its strength
 away and will need help from you to stop him from spreading his _dark influence_. That's where the guilt trip starts...

** Gameplay
*** RPG-like

Apart from the cliche beginning, the world around the adventure is well thought,
you make smoothies as you would make potions in a normal RPGs,
ennemies are gym accessories, your armor is nothing more than your training
outfits... What's really good is that they adapted **ALL** the concept of a
 RPG.

And the main one. The role playing experience. Have you ever dreamt of playing
Link and swinging your sword around? I did. Ok, it's not as cool as a sword
but you'll still have the same feeling. The one that your actual actions
affects the environment and ennemies. The most impressive one is that
exercises have different strength against ennemies and some of the hardest
attack will inflict more damages. So harder the exercise the more damage you do,
and that's when the strategy comes in because you can't fire all those strong
attack because your body can't take it. Does not fill like some heros on DBZ/Naruto/One Piece?

*** Mini Games
    To gamify even more physical activities, Nintendo went even further and
added mini-games to the list. This way, you can invite some friends for
a drink, play "who can do the more push-ups" and have some fun! Just kidding
the mini-games are actually pretty fun and the list is well furnished:
- Smash the moles like minigame (works your pecs / arms)
- Aeorplane precision game (work your triceps)
- Shooting games (Mainly working on your arms) <= that's the only one everyone
will want to play
- Beat'em up like (Works your core by pressing the ring on your abs and you have
to rotate to smash the robots around you)

*** Farming
    How could we speak about RPGs without speaking of farming/grinding?
The game gets some mechanics of classic RPGs, as it's not open world, you
would farm specific levels to gather ingredients to make smoothies. You can
even grind XPs but the game will get easier and you'll loose the benefit
of training.


** Will I turn like Schwarzy?

   Definitely not. The game will strengthen you a lot, working on your core,
 posture, legs and many other parts. However, if you stick to the adventure,
the game will not push you too hard. Between exercices, you'll have dialogues
to rest. As well, the game will make sure that you work on all the parts of
the body, so you'll end up with a well rounded shaped body. But nothing like
our boy Arnold. You'll look like more to Jet Lee to be honest. And that's a
honour :smnile:.

However, you can stick to exrecises if you do not enjoy the adventure that much.
This mode will look like if you were going to the gym with a coach. You can
pick up the specific parts of the body you want to work on and focus on them.

*** The exercises
The exercises are categorised in 4 themes: arms, legs, core and yoga.

I guess you understood all the different categories but let me enumerate some
of the exercises you could find in the game:
For the arms part, there's front press or even using the ring like a bow (
pretty good for your triceps :smile:).
The Legs will have the different kind of squats (wide/normal), mountain climber
and some cardio exercises where you have to knee-lifting (TODO check term).
Core will have the famous and feared plank, some stretching of the core and
crunch (TODO check)
And Yoga, you'll be able to some warrior poses, chairs and trees. It was a
really good introduction to it for me and really enjoy those exercises!

** Conclusion


To be honest, I love this _game_. It literally brings the gym into your
switch. It's the perfect mix between augmented reality with a nice accessory (I was not expecting sweating so much with
this bloody ring) and sports. You can adjust the difficulty to your fitness
level and focus on getting better. Finally a RPG where you are actually
the hero :champagne: (to drink with moderation, of course). So if you're
new to fitness, an afficionado or just curious, I highly recommend you
to get it! However, this post is not responsible for your daily addiction
of dopamine.

Sur ce, jouez bien! xoxo.
