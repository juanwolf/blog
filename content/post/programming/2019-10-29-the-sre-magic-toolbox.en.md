One thing that surprised me the most after 3 years as a DevOps, Sys. Admin and SRE is that developers consider your terminal as a magic box. Cursors moving around by the power of your thoughts, asking the system what you need like you were talking to it directly. To be honest, there's nothing complicated. Let's see how we do it.


## Bash

### Search in the history

If you live within a terminal all day long, grabbing a previous command from the history is ez pz for you. However I saw some "surprises" when introducing the lovely CTRL + R shortcut to some engineers. This shortcut will execute a backward search in your bash history.

A must have.

### Vim Bindings

That will depend of taste, of course. If you use the editor already, you must not let that possibility behind you. Moving around the shell will get easier with few vim shortcuts.


## GNU/Linux is your friend

First of all, let's not forget that your computer is a tool. A tool that diserves to be mastered. The main problem is that Linux and GNU gives you a lot of tools. Maybe too much to get your head around to start with. But let's start slowly.

### ps

### ls

### top

### grep


## Parsing the output

Now you master what tool to use for which occasion, the question is, how to display only what we need?

### Piping

### grep

### jq

### awk

### sort & uniq
