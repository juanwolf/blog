Yo ! Today, we'll see how to build a django application with a
continuous integration system. With this installation maybe you will
loose few times, but you will save time on every deployment of the
application, and we know how it can be frustrating to deploy something.
So you'll never have this feeling again because all will be
automatized, you'll just need to do a little click and let jenkins
rocks :). Let's see how to do that !!!

Jenkins
-------

Jenkins is continuous integration server. He will give us the
possibility to automatize few task like pull the sources of your
project, send an email to the guy who broke the build (my favorite
feature), etc... In our case, we want to use Jenkins to deploy
automatically our application every time a functionnality is developped
on it. It can seem easy, but not really.

JENKINS INSTALLATION
--------------------

For Arch Linux :

    sudo pacman -S jenkins
    sudo systemctl start jenkins

For Ubuntu :

    wget -q -O - https://jenkins-ci.org/debian/jenkins-ci.org.key | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install jenkins

Normally, jenkins should run on your machine. His default port is the
8090, so you should be able to go on this
URL[http://localhost:8090/](http://localhost:8090). (Too easy this
tutorial)

Virtual Environnement installation
----------------------------------

I give you the advice to create a virtual environment for your project.
So that will protect you from every python update or just system update
because your application will have his own python environment !

To install it we will do :

    sudo pacman -S python-virtualenv

And after that we can create an environment easily with this command :

    virtualenv /the/path/where/I/keep/my/project/

And we will use this command to activate it :

    source /le/path/ou/je/stocke/mon/env/bin/activate

Easy no ?

UWSGI installation
------------------

To launch our django application, we will need of UWSGI.

For that, install uwsgi and uwsgi-python (python module for uwsgi) :

    sudo pacman -S uwsgi
    sudo pacman -S uwsgi-plugin-python


For Debian/Ubuntu :

    sudo apt-get install uwsgi
    sudo apt-get install uwsgi-plugin-python

Don't forget to adapt that in function of your python version. In my
case, I'm using the third version.

However the problem is, our installation is dependant of the system
again. So we should install uwsgi directly from the virtual
environnement to keep a safe environment. For that we have to use pip or
add uwsgi to our requirements.txt file and we will not need the plugin
now.

    pip install uwsgi

Launching our django application
--------------------------------

Now, you have to choice, configure jenkins and wait his first deploy to
have the project sources on your server, or you have already a version
of it on your server. Here we'll suppose we have it already. To easily
run our application, we will need an .ini file to configure properly
UWSGI execution. Here's an example .ini file for my project
mon-amour-pour-jean-travolta

    #mon-amour-pour-jean-travolta.ini file
    [uwsgi]
    # We specify the module to use (no need if you installed uwsgi with pip)
    plugins = python
    # Django-related settings
    # Project root (where is manage.py)
    chdir           = /path/to/your/application/mon-amour-pour-jean-travolta/
    # wsgi file
    module          = mon-amour-pour-jean-travolta.wsgi:application
    # Absolute path to your virtual environmentChemin absolu vers l'environnement virtuel
    home            = /path/to/your/application/mon-amour-pour-jean-travolta/venv-python3-application/

    # process-related settings
    # master
    master          = true
    # Number of worker for your application
    processes       = 10
    # Unix socket
    socket          = /chemin/vers/lapplication/mon-amour-pour-jean-travolta/juanwolfs-blog.sock
    # If you want to let open your application on this server without an nginx, uncomment the line below
    # socket = 127.0.0.1:8888
    # Socket permission
    chmod-socket    = 644
    # processus user
    uid = jean-travolta
    # processus group
    gid = jean-travolta
    # socket owner
    chown_socket = jean-travolta
    # Create a server for your application (let this value commented the time to debug everything)
    # daemonize = /var/log/uwsgi/juanwolfs-blog.log
    # Clean the environment when we kill the application
    vacuum          = true

If everything is well done, your application should run with the command
:

    uwsgi --ini mon-amour-pour-jean-travolta.ini

Here, the problem is we can't properly restart automatically the
application, we need to kill the process and relaunch it. After few
useless researches, I had to ask the advice of an expert. Here's what
he said :

> [@Juan__Wolf](https://twitter.com/Juan__Wolf) I tend to use
> touch-reload (<http://t.co/cGNueQDzad>), which allows you to specify a
> file that, when touched, restarts uwsgi.

Thanks a lot [@dominicrodger](https://twitter.com/dominicrodger) for
the help ! So let's add the option to our command:

    uwsgi --ini mon-amour-pour-jean-travolta.ini --touch-reload mon-amour-pour-jean-travolta.ini
    # And we use this command to reload it
    touch mon-amour-pour-jean-travolta.ini

Automatisation
--------------

Now, we have the tools we need to deploy our application with only one click. We need to create the job which will execute all the command we should execute if we did the deployment manually. It's simple, we want: pull the source, launch the virtual environment, download the dependencies, launch the test, change the database if it needs to (I use a django module for that called South), generate translation files, restart the application and leave the virtual environment.

### Jenkins Configuration

To pull the sources of our application, we will need to host this code
somewhere using git or svn or cvs (or dropbox, LOL, just kidding). If
you're using git, you'll need to install a plugin for it. Just go in
Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugin -> "Availables" ->
"GIT plugin". And if you wanted to install your application to an
other server by ssh, install the "Publish Over SSH" plugin.

### Job Creation

We will create our job, for that click on "new item". For this
example, I will call my job
"jean-travolta-l-integration-qui-envoie-du-pate" (don't worry if
you don't get a clue of what it means), and select free-style project.
Now we have to configure the job to make him doing all the task we say
previously. Let's start with "pulling the sources".

#### Pulling the sources

Rendez-vous to the section "gestion du code source". You have many
options (CVS, Subversion, Git (If you installed the plugin)). In my
case, I will use git and put this values :

![Pull](/post_content/2015-03-28/df53e5ec-d147-40a1-9186-a3669789d617.png)

Put some attention on the branch option, you can specify which branch
you want to pull and that's really usefull when you're working on
different branch for different environment. For the last section we will
say to jenkins to check if there's modifications on the git repository
every two minutes and if there's it will launch the build.

#### Building

Now, we just need to do all the rest. So we will create a little script
(bash) which will execute everything for us. Mine looks like that :


    #!/bin/bash
    virtualenv -q venv-python3-blog # Virtual Environment creation if it doesn't exist
    source ./venv-python3-blog/bin/activate # Activate the virtual environment
    pip install -r $WORKSPACE/requirements.txt # Install all the dependencies for the application
    python $WORKSPACE/mon-amour-pour-jean-travolta/manage.py test blogengine # Launching tests

    python $WORKSPACE/mon-amour-pour-jean-travolta/manage.py schemamigration blogengine --auto --update # Find if there's modification in the database (SOUTH)
    python $WORKSPACE/mon-amour-pour-jean-travolta/manage.py migrate # apply modification in the database
    cd $WORKSPACE/mon-amour-pour-jean-travolta/;
    python manage.py compilemessages # Generate translations files

    touch $WORKSPACE/mon-amour-pour-jean-travolta.ini # Restart the application

    deactivate # We leave the virtual environment

Launch the build, and normally we should have something like that :

![Console](/post_content/2015-03-28/6d9e3612-4c4e-485b-b87a-d157c1edb434.png)


Et voil√†, We have our continuous integration platform for our django
application ! However, about tests, we don't have any reports or good
metrics about the quality of our production (except in the console, but
that's not mean anything).


BONUS - Create tests reports
----------------------------

The goal here is to use tools to evaluate the quality of our code. for
that,, we will need to modify a little bit our project and our jenkins
build. Firstly, install the JUnit, Cobertura and Violation plugin inside
Jenkins! For the project, you'll need to add django-jenkins and
coverage as requirements inside your ... requirements file. This django
module will create the report which will be rendered in jenkins (nice,
isn't it?). So let's add that to our requirement.txt :

    django-jenkins==0.16.4
    coverage==3.7.1

So now, we will modify a little bit our build. Firstly, change in your
bash script the line where we were running the tests to use our new
depency "django-jenkins" :

    #OLD
    #python $WORKSPACE/mon-amour-pour-jean-travolta/manage.py test blogengine
    # New
    python $WORKSPACE/mon-amour-pour-jean-travolta/manage.py jenkins --enable-coverage blogengine


Now, let's add our report rendering like that :

![Report](/post_content/2015-03-28/b3f8a820-ec66-42f4-9710-590a2fe21f40.png)

And if we launch few times the build (JUnit plugin need to be built
twice to render), we will have this nice layout :

![](/post_content/2015-03-28/4b3357a1-5a08-48b6-abdf-6c42ba0d6e86.png)

So I'm able now to say that my 22 tests cover more than 90% of the code
of my application. YEAH YEAH YEAH.

Conclusion
----------

Now you have no excuse to not develop your django application now you
have nothing to do to put it in production ! You just install a software
factory which give quality indications on your application and that's
quite good if you want to build a software with many people so you are
able to reject some commit if the quality is not good enough. If you
know other metrics / renderer / informations really useful to integrate
inside jenkins, let me know I will love you ! Well I let you code !
Codez bien, Ciao !
