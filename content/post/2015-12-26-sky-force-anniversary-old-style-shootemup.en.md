Introduction
------------

Sky Force Anniversary is the anniversary episode of the mobile game [Sky Force 2014](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.idreams.skyforcehd).
 This new version is available on smartphones and Steam since
April 2015 (yeah, I'm a bit late). I found this game a bit randomly. I
was playing the game on mobile and I found the gameplay a bit hard for a
smartphone game, so I looked for a similar one on steam and I found the
same :) :) :).

Story
-----

Story and shoot'em up, that's not the biggest point to speak
of. To be brief, you're the pilot of an aircraft trying to eradicate
all evils aircraft, but the boss appears and kicks your ass destroying
you. So you decide to take revenge starting from scratch a whole new
adventure...

Gameplay
--------

Before to speak properly of the gameplay of the game, let's talk about
what's a shoot'em up.

### Shoot'em Up

 So what's a Shoot'em up ? They have been introduced in 1961
with a game called
[Spacewar!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar_%28video_game%29)
But usually, you'll ear that Space Invaders introduced this new genre.
(Well I thought that too, my bad).

If we listen grandpa wikipedia, "shoot'em up" or "shoot them
up" is a subgenre of the shooter genre where the player character
engages a lone assault often in a spacecraft or aircraft shooting large
numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks.

### Sky Force

 In Sky Force, you'll have a main fire and other upgrades:

-    Laser - Create a vertical lazer destroying everything
    touching it.
-    Shield - Protects you during a lttle time
-    Megabomb - Create an aura around the aircraft which destroy
    everything on its way.


#### Ammos

During your missions, you'll find ammos for your aircraft. You can buy
them at the begginning of the mission against stars. This ammo are not
seen often so upgrade first your main fires.

#### Cards

You can find during your missions cards that pops up randomly (but more
often i the 6th mission but that's a secret). They will unlock passive
upgrades such as +10% damage with missiles, or 2x stars, etc\... They
are 22 to collect.

#### Goals

 To unlock new difficulty levels for each missions, you'll need
to finish each 4 goals of each missions.

 If it is not understable: For the first mission, You'll start at
the "normal" level" if you finish the 4 goals, you'll unlock
the "hard" level and if you finish the 4 goals you'll unlock the
"insane" level.

 I'm sure you wonder what it's the point to unlock harder levels
? Well that will adds multiplicaters of stars so that will be faster to
collect stars on harder levels.

 Missions are a bit the same (there's only 4 differents if we
forget the 5th mission). They are:

-   Destroy 70% of ennemies
-   Destroy all ennemies
-   Rescue all the survivors
-   Do not take any damage

#### Survivors

 During your missions, you'll find survivors. Your goal will be
to save them all staying above them during few seconds to pick them
up.

Hangar
------

That's the place where you'll be able to buy upgrade for your aicraft.
You can buy upgrades using the stars you collected during your mission.

Difficulty
----------

The game will seem a bit hard the first time because your aircraft is a
bit b\*\*\*shit, but once you have all the upgrade, you'll be able to
finish the game in the insane mode. Well, you'll be able, I didn't say
it will be easy. Don't forget that shoot'em up are skill games at
first.

Conclusion
----------

That's a really good game for 10â‚¬ even if it's a bit short.
You'll need more than 10 hours to finish it properly. I really
recommend it for you and you should try it, it's half price during
christmas sales on Steam! But even though mates, enjoy your holidays and
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!!!
